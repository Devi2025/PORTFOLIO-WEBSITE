Description:

The Portfolio Website is a personal web-based platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as a digital resume and creative space where visitors can learn more about my work, download my CV, and get in touch. The site features a responsive and user-friendly design, ensuring optimal viewing across all devices. It highlights key sections such as an "About Me" introduction, project gallery, technical skills, and contact form. This project demonstrates my front-end development abilities, UI/UX design sense, and commitment to clean, accessible web development.
